# tofu assigner

## todo:

* Preferred # of shifts of each thing
* Max shifts per week
* Max quota per week
* Max shifts per day
* Startup shifts splittable -- how to do this?
* Double shifts allowed by some people
* I think getting all the shifts assigned is the only hard constraint. Everything else should be a weight.
* Possibility of split shifts -- I think this is just done by having an easy-to-edit job list.
